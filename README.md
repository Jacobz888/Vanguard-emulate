# Vanguard Pipe-Hijacking Emulator

A Windows-based emulator that uses a pipe-hijacking strategy to intercept and emulate Vanguard anti-cheat communication.

## Overview

This emulator implements a **pipe-hijacking strategy** rather than full service replacement:

1. Stop Vanguard services (vgk/vgc)
2. Create and hijack the named pipe communication channel
3. Restart Vanguard services (they handle their own initialization)
4. Echo back client messages to satisfy integrity checks

## Architecture

### Pipe-Hijacking Strategy

Instead of replacing the Vanguard services entirely, this emulator:
- Allows the real services to handle complex initialization
- Intercepts the communication pipe before services restart
- Echoes messages back to satisfy client-side checks
- Avoids reimplementing complex kernel-mode drivers

### Project Structure

```
/src/
  main.cpp              - Entry point and orchestration

```

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **Compiler**: Visual Studio 2019 or later with C++17 support
- **Windows SDK**: 10.0 or later
- **Privileges**: Administrator rights required

## Building

### Visual Studio

1. Open `VanguardEmulator.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Select configuration (Debug or Release)
3. Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
4. Executable will be in `bin/Debug/` or `bin/Release/`

### Configuration

The project links against:
- `psapi.lib` - Process Status API
- `kernel32.lib` - Windows kernel functions
- `user32.lib` - User interface functions
- `advapi32.lib` - Advanced Windows services

C++ Standard: C++17 or later

## Configuration

Edit `config.ini` to customize behavior:

```ini
# Named pipe GUID (Vanguard communication pipe)
pipe_name=933823D3-C77B-4BAE-89D7-A92B567236BC

# Buffer size for pipe communication (100MB default)
buffer_size=104857600

# Delay between stopping and restarting services (milliseconds)
service_restart_delay=2000

# Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
log_level=INFO
```

## Usage

1. **Run as Administrator**:
   ```
   Right-click VanguardEmulator.exe -> Run as administrator
   ```

2. The emulator will:
   - Stop Vanguard services (vgk, vgc)
   - Create the named pipe: `\\.\pipe\933823D3-C77B-4BAE-89D7-A92B567236BC`
   - Restart Vanguard services
   - Listen for and echo pipe messages

3. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the emulator

## Technical Details

### Named Pipe Configuration

- **Pipe Name**: `933823D3-C77B-4BAE-89D7-A92B567236BC`
- **Pipe Type**: `PIPE_TYPE_MESSAGE | PIPE_WAIT`
- **Access Mode**: `PIPE_ACCESS_DUPLEX` (bidirectional)
- **Instances**: `PIPE_UNLIMITED_INSTANCES`
- **Buffer Size**: 100MB (configurable)

### Privilege Elevation

The emulator acquires `SeDebugPrivilege` to:
- Access protected system processes
- Interact with kernel-mode services
- Control system services

### Service Management

Controls the following services:
- **vgk**: Vanguard kernel-mode driver
- **vgc**: Vanguard user-mode client

Operations:
- Stop services before hijacking
- Restart services after pipe creation
- Query service status

### Message Handling

The pipe server uses an **echo strategy**:
1. Receive message from client
2. Log message size and content (debug mode)
3. Echo message back verbatim
4. Flush buffers to ensure delivery

This satisfies basic integrity checks without deep protocol knowledge.

### Threading Model

- **Thread-per-connection**: Each client connection gets a dedicated handler thread
- **Accept thread**: Main thread continuously accepts new connections
- **Graceful shutdown**: All threads join on shutdown signal

## Components

### Logger (`logger.h/cpp`)

Provides thread-safe logging with:
- Multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- File and console output
- Timestamp precision to milliseconds

### Config (`config.h/cpp`)

Manages configuration:
- INI file parsing
- Default values
- Type conversion helpers

### ServiceManager (`service_manager.h/cpp`)

Controls Windows services:
- Start/stop individual services
- Restart with delays
- Query service status
- Wait for state transitions

### PipeServer (`pipe_server.h/cpp`)

Implements named pipe server:
- Create message-type pipes
- Accept multiple connections
- Echo message handling
- Thread-safe operations

## Logging

Logs are written to:
- **Console**: Real-time output
- **File**: `vanguard_emulator.log`

Log format:
```
[2024-01-15 14:30:45.123] [INFO] Message text
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to open Service Control Manager"
- Ensure running as Administrator
- Check Windows services are accessible

### "Failed to create named pipe"
- Verify pipe name is not already in use
- Check administrator privileges

### "Failed to adjust privileges"
- Run as Administrator
- Check Windows security policy settings

### Services fail to start/stop
- Verify vgk/vgc services exist on system
- Check service permissions
- Review Windows Event Viewer

## Technical Notes

### Why Pipe-Hijacking?

Traditional approaches to anti-cheat emulation require:
- Reimplementing complex kernel drivers
- Understanding proprietary protocols
- Maintaining driver signatures

Pipe-hijacking offers advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Let real services handle initialization
- **Maintenance**: No driver reverse engineering needed
- **Compatibility**: Services update themselves
- **Testing**: Easy to validate communication patterns

### Limitations

This is a **foundation** implementation:
- Echo strategy is naive (real protocol may be complex)
- No cryptographic verification
- No anti-tampering detection
- Basic message handling only

Future enhancements would require:
- Protocol reverse engineering
- Message validation
- Cryptographic implementations
- Anti-detection measures

## Development

- **Structure Analysis**: Length field and encoding detection

#### Usage

1. **Enable Analysis** (automatic in current build):
   ```cpp
   pipeServer.enableProtocolAnalysis(true);
   ```

2. **Set DEBUG Logging** in `config.ini`:
   ```ini
   log_level=DEBUG
   ```

3. **Run and Capture**:
